  ##  :hammer_and_wrench: Features Under Development: 
  - The app currently only consists of the UI. Functionality will be added later.
  - I will transition from using multiple activities to a single activity with multiple fragments based on the Navigation library.
  - Payment and MyTask sections will be added.
